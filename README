    ~ What is lily?

      A sqlite powered sentiment and keyword analysis site

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the lily.py file or
         export an FLASKR_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. initialize the database with this command:

         flask --app=lily initdb

      3. now you can run lily:

         flask --app=lily run

         the application will greet you on
         http://localhost:5000/

    ~ Is it tested?

      Not Yet! Still need to update all that.
